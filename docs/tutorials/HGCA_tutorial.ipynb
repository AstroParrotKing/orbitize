    "# Fitting the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Acclerations (HGCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jason Wang (2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate how to fit the stellar absolute astrometry from the [Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA; Brandt 2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..254...42B/abstract) to help constrain the mass and orbital parameters of the companion. This is an alternative to fitting the Hipparcos IAD and Gaia astrometry. We encourage users to try both to see how similar or different the results are, as the two methods utilize the same underlying data. The implementation of fitting the HGCA here is based on [Brandt et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158..140B/abstract), but utilizes the DR3 version of the HGCA. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Obtain the necessary data\n",
    "\n",
    "While `orbitize!` will automatically download the HGCA catalog, you need to obtain two other data files to reconstruct the Hipparcos and Gaia observations for your star. These files tell us when and in what orientation did Hipparcos and Gaia take data of the star for the forward modeling that happens in `orbitize!`. \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. The Hipparcos IAD file of the star. Follow the section in the [Hipparocs IAD tutorial](https://orbitize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Hipparcos_IAD.html#Part-1:-Obtaining-the-IAD) on how to obtain this file for your star of interest.\n",
    "  2. The anticipated Gaia epochs and scan directions in a CSV file that is obtained from the [Gaia Observation Forecast Tool (GOST)](https://gaia.esac.esa.int/gost/). For GOST, after entering the target name and resolving its coordinates, use 2014-07-26T00:00:00 as the start date. For the end date, use 2016-05-23T00:00:00 for DR2 and 2017-05-28T00:00:00 for EDR3. You probably will be fitting the EDR3. The output CSV file is all you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup the `HGCALogProb` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The user just needs to setup the `orbitize.gaia.HGCALogProb` object, which will handle the rest of the HGCA modeling under the hood. To setup the `HGCALogProb` object, we also need to create an `orbitize.hipparcos.HipparcosLogProb` instance, but it will not actually be used in the fitting. It is simply used to handle reading in the Hipparcos IAD to maximize code reuse. \n",

    "After you do this step, the rest of the orbit fit setup is basically the same as a standard `orbitize!` orbit fit. The only differences is that you need to pass the `HGCALogProb` object into the system class (but not the `HipparcosLogProb` because the Hipparcos data is already being handled in HGCA). We also recommend you explicitly set up the system to fit for the dynamical mass of the companions in the system (this should happen automatically with the inclusion of HGCA data, but we recommend being explicit so it is clear what you are fitting for).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also note that that the default prior on the companion mass is a log-uniform prior between 1e-6 and 2 solar masses. If you want a more restricted mass, now is also the time to adjust that. We present one example here, but refer to the Modifying Priors tutorial for further details. "
