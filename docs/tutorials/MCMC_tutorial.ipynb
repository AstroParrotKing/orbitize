    "\n",
    "Here, we will explain how to sample an orbit posterior using MCMC techniques. MCMC samplers take some time\n",
    "to fully converge on the complex posterior, but should be able to explore all posteriors in roughly the same\n",
    "amount of time (unlike OFTI). We will use the parallel-tempered version of the Affine-invariant sample from\n",
    "the `emcee` package, as the parallel tempering helps the walkers get out of local minima. Parallel-tempering can\n",
    "be disabled by setting the number of temperatures to 1, and will revert back to using the regular ensemble \n",

    "\n",
    "When setting up the sampler, we need to decide how many temperatures and how many walkers per temperature\n",
    "to use. Increasing the number of temperatures further ensures your walkers will explore all of parameter space\n",
    "and will not get stuck in local minima. Increasing the number of walkers gives you more samples to use, and, for\n",
    "the Affine-invariant sampler, a minimum number is required for good convergence. Of course, the trade off is that\n",
    "more samplers means more computation time. We find 20 temperatures and 1000 walkers to be reliable for convergence. Since this is a tutorial meant to be run quickly, we use fewer walkers and temperatures here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we will only use the samples from the lowest temperature walkers only. We also assume that our astrometric measurements follow a Gaussian distribution.\n",
