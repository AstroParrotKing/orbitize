Tutorials
=========

The following tutorials walk you through performing orbit fits with
``orbitize``. To get started, read through "Formatting Inputs," "OFTI
Introduction," and "MCMC Introduction." To learn more about the 
``orbitize`` API (and to learn how to modify priors), check out "Modifying 
Priors." To learn about the differences between OFTI and MCMC algorithms,
we suggest "OFTI vs MCMC."

Many of these tutorials are also available as jupyter notebooks 
`here <https://github.com/sblunt/orbitize/tree/master/docs>`_.

If you find a bug, or if something is unclear, please create an issue
on GitHub! We'd love any feedback on how to make ``orbitize`` more
accessible.
